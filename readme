This is an old code and deprecated. 
When this code was written the largest AWS EC2 instance (~64Gb RAM) could barely hold the follower graph data in memory.
However this is not the case today, you can easily get a large memory (~240Gb RAM) cluster EC2 instance which allows community detection to run in-memory, thus obviating need for using hadoop.
